# 🔐 Password Strength Prediction

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning project to predict the strength of passwords—classified as **strong**, **average**, or **weak**—based on semantic and structural features.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a classification model that analyzes password strings to determine their strength. It uses common NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data that correspond to varying levels of password security.

## 🚀 Features

- Classifies password strength into three categories: `strong`, `average`, and `weak`.
- Utilizes **TF-IDF vectorization** to convert password text into numerical features.
- Implements machine learning models like **Logistic Regression** for classification.
- Includes end-to-end pipeline: data cleaning, feature extraction, training, and evaluation.
- Visualizes insights and model performance using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Model Workflow

1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Vectorize text data using TF-IDF
4. Train ML models and evaluate performance
5. Visualize and interpret results

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of passwords labeled by their strength. It includes a mix of real-world and simulated password examples.

## 📈 Results

The model achieves high classification accuracy with Logistic Regression, and reveals valuable patterns about password structure and security.
